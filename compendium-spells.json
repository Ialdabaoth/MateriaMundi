You can focus your mind on any one creature within 5 paces of you that you can see or detect with this spell. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature you focus on — what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, you must make a magic roll vs. its Willpower DV . If you succeed, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If you fail, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make a Willpower saving throw to break the spell. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation."

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered. Make a magic roll as you cast the spell; the glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Deduction saving throw against your roll to be found. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, the alarm sounds and the spell ends. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. If you peerform this spell as a ritual, you may weave one other spell from your spellbook into the glyph. When a creature triggers the glyph, the other spell activates, targeting them or centering on the space they are in."

For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

				"Content": "Modify Spell allows you to create a new spell by weaving Arcane metamagics into an existing spell that you know. Each metamagic woven into the original spell effect increases the Circle of the new spell by 1. Performing this ritual costs one full bottle of magic ink and one Dragon Pearl with a rarity equal to the circle of the new spell, both of which are consumed during the ritual. When youfinish the ritual, you make an Arcana test vs. the new spell’s circle. If you succeed, the new spell works as intended, and you add it to your spellbook. Modifying a spell with multiple metamagics can produce a spell of fourth or even higher circle; such spells can only be cast with the aid of powerful artifacts. This spell can only be cast as a ritual. You may choose any of the following metamagics: \nPermanence - This metamagic requires a substantial investment in time and resources. The spell to be made permanent must be cast as a ritual before each sunrise and sunset for one lunar month, with a pinch of diamond dust and materia residue added to the material components of each ritual casting. Each time you cast a ritual spell with this metamagic, its effects last until the next sunrise or sunset without requiring concentration to maintain it; on the sunset of the last day, the spell becomes permanent until dispelled if you choose to sacrifice a Dragon Pearl of the correct element and rarity at the culmination of the ritual. Performing this ritual in the hour before sunrise or sunset halves the total number of spells that you can prepare at this time; you may use your Arcane Recovery feat to prepare your remaining spells throughout the day. \nCareful Spell - This metamagic modifies a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw to protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. When you cast the spell, you choose a number of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier. A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. \nDistant Spell - This metamagic doubles a spell’s range if it has a range of 3 paces or more, or gives it a range of 5 paces if it normally has a range of touch or 1 to 2 paces. \nEmpowered Spell - This metamagic increases a spell’s damaging power. When you roll damage for this spell, you can replace up to half the spell’s damage dice with their maximum possible values. \nRobust Spell - This metamagic causes any attempt to dispel or counterspell that spell to have disadvantage. \nSeeking Spell - This metamagic grants you advantage on a spell’s attack rolls. \nQuickened Spell - If a spell uses an action to cast, you can increase its Circle by two to create a version that can be cast as your reaction. Attack spells that can be cast as a reaction may be used to perform opportunity attacks. \nSubtle Spell - This metamagic allows you to create a version of a spell with subdued somatic and verbal components. You must make an Arcana or Finesse saving throw (your choice) whenever you cast the modified spell to perform it correctly without any somatic or verbal gestures. Any creature whose Perception DV is less than your check result will not notice that you are casting the spell, and will thus be unable to counter it. You may also use this version of the spell when restrained or unable to speak, by making the same saving throw."

You may also use this spell to examine an ingestible substance, to determine whether it is safe to eat or drink. Dedicate Object First Circle Elemental Ritual This ritual is used primarily by shapeshifters. By ‘marking’ a single hand-held or worn object as your own, you leave a small trace of yourself within it, and a small trace of itself within you. Whenever you shapeshift (for example, by use of the Druid’s Wild Shape ability), all marked items that you are currently wearing or holding shapeshift with you, merging into your animal form. When you transform back, these items will shift back with you. You can mark a total number of items equal to your spellcasting proficiency. When you are at this limit, you must un-dedicate one of your items of your choice whenever you dedicate a new one. You do not need to be in possession of the old item to un-dedicate it. You can only mark items that you crafted yourself, or that were gifted to you by another Druid that crafted it themselves. The item cannot contain any iron or steel anywhere in its construction. Having too many dedicated items can be dangerous – when a dedicated item is not in your possession, you can close your eyes as an action or reaction to sense where it is. If it is within 20 paces of you, you know where it is to within 1 pace; if it is further away, you know its direction and approximate distance (within 100 paces, within 1 mile, within 20 miles, further than 20 miles). While someone else is holding an item dedicated to you, they have advantage on all magic rolls and magic rolls that target you, and you have disadvantage on all saving throws vs any magics cast by them that target only you."

				"Speed": "Ritual",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Air or Water Spell",
				"Content": "You may cast this spell as your action while outdoors in a heavy storm. For as long as you maintain concentration, you may use your action each round to influence the storm for 25 paces around you. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early. Winds can be used to push affected creatures up to 3 paces in a direction of your choice; one full action may be spent to push any creatures within a circle 10 paces wide or a cone 40 paces deep. Each creature within the affected area must brace with advantage or be knocked prone; on a critical success, that creature also manages to avoid being moved. Lightning called from the clouds inflicts three dice of damage to each creature within one pace of the strike point that fails to dodge the strike; creatures in metal armor have disadvantage to their dodge saving throw. Strikes against trees orflammable objects may ignite them at the referee’s discretion. Hail and sleet strikes a much wider area, dealing one die of cold damage to each creature within the entire 25-pace area. Each creature affected can resist to halve the damage; well-insulated clothing can provide advantage to this saving throw at the referee’s discretion. If you cast this spell as a ritual, you may conjure a storm from a clear sky over the course of an hour, rolling the spell’s power to determine the number of hours that the storm will last. You may alternatively use this ritual to calm a storm in progress, dissipating it into clear skies. If two druids each perform this ritual at cross-purposes within a mile of each other, a Nature test determines which ritual succeeds."

			"Druid Grove": {
				"Speed": "Ritual",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Fey Ritual",
				"Content": "During this ritual, you sanctify a circular area up to 30 paces in radius, bringing Faerie and the Material closer together within it. Some kind of border marker, usually a ring of mushrooms or a wild thorny hedge, will spring out of the ground around the borders as you complete the ritual. Within the grove, all spellcasting rolls for druidic and fey magic have advantage, and all spellcasting rolls for other forms of magic have disadvantage. Any creature enchanted within the grove by the Awaken Beast or Awaken Plant rituals may be tasked with defending the grove indefinitely, rather than serving you directly. Other rituals, such as Call Storm, Entangle, Heat Metal, Leyline Travel, Mirage, Nature’s Wrath, Summon Elemental, or Verdant Growth, may be woven into the grove’s defenses and features as well. If you cast this ritual in the same place each sunrise and sunset for one lunar month, and leave at least one numen of each elemental aspect within the area to tend to the grove, the effects of this ritual become permanent until dispelled, along with any other defensive rituals woven into it. Druids who maintain a permanent Druid Grove usually continue to perform the necessary rituals at each sunrise and sunset, weaving their magic deeper and deeper into the bones of the earth. Each additional consecutive lunar month that the rituals continue to be performed each sunrise and sunset, the difficulty to dispel the grove’s magics increase by 1; missing a day reduces the difficulty to dispel by 1 each month until it is reduced to a minimum CoF of 1."

			"Leyline Travel": {
				"Speed": "Ritual",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Fey Spell",
				"Content": "As an action, you touch a surface made of living plant matter - such as a tree or vine-covered wall - and a portal opens through the veil into Faerie. When you step through, an identical portal appears on another such surface that you can see within 60 paces, which you instantly step out of back into the Material world. You may choose to keep the portal open while you maintain concentration, allowing others to follow you. If cast as a ritual, you may attempt to link to any large tree or natural living archway that you have seen, even at great distance. Make a Nature test with a CoF equal to the number of leagues of distance between the two portals; on a failure, you step out of a portal somewhere in between, determined randomly by the referee."

			"Meld With Earth": {
				"Speed": "Action",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Stone Spell",
				"Content": "You step into a natural stone or earthen object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all dedicated equipment with the earth for as long as you maintain concentration. Using your movement, you step into the earth at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by non-magical senses. While merged with the earth, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Perception checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the earth. You can use your movement to leave the earth where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move. Minor physical damage to the earth doesn’t harm you, but its destruction or a change in its shape or substance (to the extent that it is no longer natural earth or you no longerfit within it) expels you and deals 3d6 bashing damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered."

			"Mirage": {
				"Speed": "Ritual",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Fey Ritual",
				"Content": "You cast this ritual to make the terrain around you look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. The ritual’s effectflows out from you in a sphere that grows one pace per minute in radius to a maximum of 60 paces in every direction, transforming your surroundings as the wave of magic passes over them. Openfields can be made to resemble difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth valley. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance. The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt to disbelieve it."

			"Nature’s Wrath": {
				"Speed": "Action",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Wood Spell",
				"Content": "You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. The spirits cause trees, roots, vines, and grasses within 5 paces of you to become animated while you maintain concentration and remain within the area. Grasses and Undergrowth - Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies. \nTrees - At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the area must dodge or take four dice of slashing damage from whipping branches. \nRoots and Vines - At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must brace or become restrained or knocked prone (your choice) until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to attempt to break free."

			"Polymorph": {
				"Speed": "Ritual",
				"Spell Level": "Third Circle",
				"Spell Type": "Primal",
				"Spell Subtype": "Wood Spell",
				"Content": "You use your action to touch another creature, transforming them instantly into a natural animal or fey beast with 3 or fewer hit dice. The creature remains transformed while you maintain concentration, replacing their racial features and ability modifiers with those of the species you have chosen. This includes mental ability modifiers; a transformed creature with an Intelligence modifier of -4 or lower is no longer considered intelligent. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech if the new form is incapable of them. Clothing and other equipment worn by the transformed creature is not affected unless that creature previously performed the dedicate object ritual on it; the transformation might damage such equipment if the creature’s new size is significantly larger than its old."
